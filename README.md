# Portfolio Project

## Introduction
This is my personal portfolio project built with Next.js, demonstrating my skills and projects. Below are the steps to get started with the development server and information on deploying the project.

## Start

To run the development server, use the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com) from the creators of Next.js.

## Previous Portfolio

This was my last version of my portfolio built with HTML and CSS. You can view it [here](https://jayounghoyos.github.io/Portfolio/).
